# Tableau-Homework---Citi-Bike-Analytics
Here is a link to my Tableau Dashboard:  [https://public.tableau.com/authoring/Dashboard1-CitiBikeAnalytics/Story1#1]
In this assignment I  aggregated the data found in the Citi Bike Trip History Logs to find two unexpected phenomena. I chose date for 2018 and 2019 years.
I wanted co compare the usage of citi bike before and during COVID time. I found a few interesting phenomena.
1. The usage of citibike in 2019 increased by 14%.
2. The proportion of short-term customers and annual subscribers in 2019 has changed by 5 %. The number of subscibers descreased by 5%. Possibly some clients didn't want to commit to the subscribtion because of uncertainty in begininning of pandemic.
3. The majority of clients were male: 77% in 2018 and 76% in 2019.
4. Clients born in 1969 and in 1988 had the longest trips in 2018 and 2019.
